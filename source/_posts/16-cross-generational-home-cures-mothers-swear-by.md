There is healing power in being looked after, a power that mothers appear to own innately. As kids, we believed a mother’s touch could cure us of any ailment or condition. Whether pain was external or internal, mothers always seemed to know precisely how to reduce us of it.

In these scenarios, it had been always the idea that counted most.

For marginalized communities, in particular, this process often requires moms to simultaneously act as cultural gatekeepers. Passed on and learned from their mothers, these rituals, and the pride in them, turn into intergenerational. Without this preservation of methods, these home remedies, and our confidence within their healing, may otherwise be lost.

From Canada to Ecuador, we sourced stories from women about the house remedies which were prevalent within their own lives.

While vapor rub and onions appeared to be favorites in curing a broad spectrum of illnesses, the various backgrounds from which these treatments stem from just would go to show that females all over the world are a lot more closely linked than we might think.

The next stories are told to show how healing reaches across generations. Please do not work with these stories as proof scientific research, medical tips, or treatment.

### On tackling colds and flu

From a age, my mother always emphasized the importance of our Mexican culture. Whenever we were ill, she often had a remedy she discovered from her mother to greatly help us feel better.

Whenever we had a freezing, she'd have us sit down on a couch with a bucket of scorching normal water at our feet. She'd spread vapor rub on the soles of our feet and have us dip them in the normal water.

While our toes were soaking, we'd to drink a hot cinnamon tea. We'd always feel better following this. I’m available to trying it once again for my very own children later on.

Besides dousing me in vapor rub, [my mom] used to create me sleep sitting upright since it apparently alleviated the starting point of a good cough almost immediately.

I would just make use of it as an excuse to learn past my bedtime.

Developing up in a Nigerian dwelling, I was raised with a holistic knowledge of wellness. One prevalent cold treatment that my mother offered if you ask me is this: fill a basin with hot water (not warm, hot) and combine in a teaspoon of Vicks Vaporub, in that case grab a dish towel.

Wet the dish towel with the mix and place it outrageous of the basin. Set your face onto the fabric and breathe deeply for 5 to ten minutes. This will distinct your sinuses and undoubtedly perhaps you have breathing right again.

It has yet to come to be published in virtually any health journals I’ve reading, but I hold it due to a sacred remedy.

Whenever we were younger, whenever one of my sisters or I would start to look sick, my mom could have us gargle salt drinking water. If we'd a sore throat, runny nose, or any flu-like symptom, we'd sometimes wait to inform her because we recognized the essential thing she’d perform is reach for the Morton Salt.

Her mother constantly had her do it, and she believed that salt killed the bacteria on the throat.

It did always appear to work, or perhaps at least help. I assume I’ll ultimately make my kids do it also since I don’t prefer the burden of closing this superstitious cycle.

My mom lives with ginger. She’s always been a major advocate for beginning with within to rectify an issue. I’ve hardly ever known a period when there wasn’t a freshly brewed pitcher of ginger beer in the fridge. It’s truthfully her cure-all when cramping, congested, or groggy.

She grinds up the ginger with lime and keeps straining until smooth. She then adds cloves and refreshments it daily. She promises it helps with strengthening her disease fighting capability. The more robust the batch, the better!

My mom is Greek and swears by scorching red wine for colds. Actually, “hot red wine” does not mean mulled wine, but putting any reddish colored you purchased at the grocery store in a mug and microwaving it for 30 seconds.

She believes the alcohol cures you, but I believe it just helps it be more bearable. I enjoyed it because it meant I could take when I was young.

### On erasing cuts and bruises

For bruises, we would eat an onion (or any red vegetable), since it was believed that those were the kinds that went directly to red bloodstream cells and helped reproduce them.

Eating an onion essentially did help [me], however the side-effect is that if you work out or sweat you smell undesirable because you’re quite simply sweating out the onion.

- Gabriella, Guayaquil, Ecuador

Growing up, my own mother always tried to heal us in a natural way normally as she may. She carried and respected the traditions passed on to her from her great-grandparents. I typically bruised easily or were left with small cuts from participating in outside with my boy cousins.

My mom would use leftover potato skins to heal my wounds. Potatoes support wounds heal faster by lowering inflammation. In addition they help breakdown hyperpigmentation so they’re great for post-wounds [scarring] as well.

### On soothing ear infections

I grew up solely by my mother. She was created in Mexico and came to the Claims at a young age. A number of the remedies she was raised with are types we still use today.

Whenever we had an earache, she'd wash our ears with warm water and follow by putting a capful of peroxide inside our ears until it fizzed. Once it halted fizzing, we would let it drain out.

- Andrea, Houston

No one was allowed to smoke within the house, but whenever someone started to get an hearing infection, my mother would light a good cigarette and set it of their ear to alleviate the itchiness.

I don’t think it really works, despite the fact that she and many of the older generation of girls I’ve met all swear by it.

- Paloma, Chicago

### On eliminating headaches

Southern Italian practices are entrenched in superstition, paganism, and rituals. Whenever I have a headache, my mom insists it’s from malocchio, the evil eyesight, and performs an essential oil and water ritual.

She reads, much like other folks would with tea leaves, the way the essential oil is moving against the normal water. If there is the existence of malocchio, another prayer ensues to rid the individual of “the curse.” To be honest, it works!

- Elisabetta, Toronto

One solution that my mom swears by is using vapor rub on your own temples, the trunk of your ears, and the trunk of your neck. Once you apply the vapor rub, peel an onion and grill the peels until they happen to be warm and soft. Once very soft, put salt along with the vapor rub. Then, put the warm onion peels on your temples.

She does this anytime she's a headache. She discovered it from her mother, and it’s been passed on for some generations.

### On purging skin-deep issues

In Honduras, my mom would use ashes from firewood when her siblings had breakouts or rashes on the skin area. The ashes would apparently lift up bacteria, chemical compounds, and dirt to the skin’s surface so that when the ashes were washed apart, so were the poisons.

It’s similar to how persons now use charcoal encounter masks for issues just like excess oil.

- Amelia, Chicago

For mosquito bites, my mother would hold half of a lime over the flame of the stove. Once the lime was charred, she would let it cool only somewhat, as it has to be fairly hot to work. Then, she would rub the charred component on the bite - the even more juice, the better.

This increased the recovery process and eliminated the itch. I definitely even now do that today because it’s hence effective and cheap. My mom discovered this from her mother and her mom-in-law. They all utilized this little trick.

### On relieving cramps and belly aches

My mom would swear on a tea created from onion skins that her mom and grandmother utilized to make her that could relieve period pains. As a picky (and naive) teenager, I usually refused her give and popped one too many Midol pills.

But one day, my soreness was too unbearable, therefore i gave in. To my shock, it worked.

Sure, it didn’t flavour amazing and I sweetened it somewhat with honey, however the onion tea soothed my menstrual cramps more rapidly than any pill. Since that time though, I’ve found different better-tasting teas that do the trick, but that one experience will constantly stay static in my book among the many definitions of “mother knows best.”

- Bianca, NEW YORK

Passed down from my superb grandmother, I was presented with spoonfuls of castor oil pertaining to various reasons, but mostly in an effort to help stomach aches. It tastes awful, but it definitely functions for me personally. Personally, it often takes two to three spoonfuls for it to attain its fullest potential.

### Healing and slowing, it’s the idea that counts

In today’s modern world, mothers from diverse backgrounds carry the duty of preserving ancient, cultural home cures - a practice in humility, in slowing down and time for our roots.

Growing up, my very own mother swore simply by spoonfuls of honey to get soothing sore throats, lemon juice to get curing cystic pimples, and sliced potatoes designed for preventing fevers. She relied on these home cures, passed down from her own mom, before reaching for anything else. Sometimes these remedies worked, though oftentimes they didn’t, that didn’t matter.

In these scenarios, it had been always the idea that counted most.

Western culture has commodified wellness, especially in the United States where companies and organizations continue to prevail above healthcare. Along the way, we’ve grown accustomed to immediate gratification instead of complete, patient healing.

Perhaps then it really is our mothers, instead of the remedies themselves, that genuinely possess the energy to heal us. By reaching out to them and hearing their testimonies, we are able to discover the elements of our histories that remain sacred.
