### Let's see dive in and see what progress they have made on A6 Max.

Elephone, the Chinese smartphone brand, is releasing its new phone, A6 Max, right after the launch of U2. This time, Elephone decided to provide a more traditional kind of mobile phone compared to U2. As a matter of fact, Elephone has released another phone called A6 Mini before. Let's see dive in and see what progress they have made on [A6 Max](https://www.elephone.hk/).

#### Design and Screen

Like other Elephones, A6 Max is also slim and sleek with simple yet outlook design. I particularly enjoy how its screen preserves the full-screen tradition of Elephone. The drop-notch design derives from that of A6 Mini is curved more smoothly while not taking up much upper space of the phone, which makes A6 Max looks more high-end (although it is indeed more expensive than A6 Mini since the latter is a budget phone). Thin bezels on the sides help to support the full-screen experience. The screen size has been broadened significantly from 5.71'' to 6.53'' comparing to A6 Mini. It is also worth mentioning that Elephone has moved the fingerprint sensor to the back of A6 Max rather than keeping it on the side as A6 Mini does. This move is wise, as it is easier and more natural for the user to unlock the phone by touching the back of the phone.

#### Camera

While preserving the 2MP sensor, A6 Max's main rear camera's megapixel has enhanced from 16MP to 20MP comparing to A6 Mini (although when considering the low price of A6 Mini, a 16MP rear camera is actually a pretty good deal). I believe it is such a bargain to acquire this level of high-quality camera performance at such an affordable price. What's more, the front camera of A6 Max is also an impressive 20MP, helping with taking clear and vivid selfies in high resolution and bright colors. Selfie lovers, you don't want to miss the chance of trying this front camera out.

#### Operation system and Network

As the latest model of Elephone, A6 Max runs smoothly on the latest Android system, Android 9.0. With the help of the MTK 6762 Processor, A6 Max shifts from apps to apps with no pauses whatsoever. Consequently, A6 Max can be a good choice for gamers or just anyone who desire to have an operating system with no delay. If you feel like the standard 64GB storage of A6 Max is insufficient, you can insert a microSD card into the nano-SIM slot to expand it up to 256GB. Thereby, you will never have to delete valuable pictures or songs that you love just to save a little storage.
